I wanted to create this project as an extension of the evenings I hosted during the first part of the school year and some of what I was working on during the first parts of quarentine.
Throughout the fall I hosted "speakeasy nights" for friends in the Club Room of Centrumâ€”my building in Evanston.
I typically worked through a menu and let guests pick which drinks I want, but my plan for the spring was to do specific cocktail "journeys" where I picked all the drinks.
I had to tweak the more traditional "places" concept a bit to get this to work properly, but I believe "cocktails" are a suitable stand-in for events and a user-based RSVP system is entirely suitable for this mission.
I hope you enjoy!
